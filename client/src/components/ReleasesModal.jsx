                      integrates Razorpay, a leading payment gateway. Razorpay
                      ensures that all customer payment information, from credit
                      card details to UPI IDs, is processed with the highest
                      level of security through PCI DSS Level 1 compliance,

                      Our website's product catalog is entirely hosted on Amazon
                      Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets. This choice was fundamental
                      for building a scalable and reliable e-commerce platform.
                      S3 provides virtually unlimited storage, ensuring we can
                      expand our sneaker collection without infrastructure

                      on a cost-effective pay-as-you-go model, and leverages
                      AWS's robust security features, including automatic
                      encryption and granular access controls, securing all
                      product information from unauthorized access and
                      integrating seamlessly for future enhancements.

                      Our commitment to a seamless user experience extends to
                      authentication, where we've integrated Google Login and
                      registration powered by Firebase. This allows customers to
                      quickly and securely access their accounts using their
                      existing Google credentials, eliminating the need to
                      create and remember new passwords. For new users, a smooth
                      registration process is automatically handled through
                      Firebase when they sign in with Google for the first time.
                      This not only enhances convenience but also leverages
                      Firebase's robust and secure authentication system,
                      providing enterprise-grade security, easy implementation,
                      and scalable user management without the overhead of
                      building a custom authentication backend.

                      Finally, to ensure optimal performance and
                      maintainability, this project is deployed on Vercel,
                      leveraging a separate backend and frontend architecture.
                      The frontend, built with React, is deployed independently
                      on Vercel, benefiting from its global CDN for
                      lightning-fast delivery to users worldwide, automatic SSL
                      certificates, and seamless CI/CD pipeline for instant
                      deployments. The backend, designed as a separate service,
                      is also hosted independently, allowing for specialized
                      scaling and robust API management. This distinct
                      separation between frontend and backend not only enhances
                      scalability and flexibility for future updates and feature
                      additions but also significantly improves developer
                      collaboration and overall application resilience, as
                      issues in one layer are less likely to impact the other.
